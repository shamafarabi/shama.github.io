Hi, I'm Shama. I am currently an engineer at Intel and did my PhD in Mechanical Engineering from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in 2018. Towards the end of my graduate school, I got myself involved in coding and rigrous data analysis. I really enjoyed it and over the last few years, I tried to hone those skills at work and through my personal projects. I created this website in an effort to share my personal data science projects.

Aside from work, I also finished a 6 month long immersive bootcamp with Springboard Academy where the curriculum covered concepts on Python for Data Science, Inferential Statistics (hypothesis testing, experimental design, A/B testing), Relational Databases (SQL), supervised & unsupervised machine learning and Neural Networks, as well as advanced topics on Time Series Forecasting, Recommender Systems, NLP and Spark.
