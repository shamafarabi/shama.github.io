I am currently an engineer at Intel and did my PhD in Mechanical Engineering from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in 2018. Towards the end of my graduate school, I got myself involved in coding and extensive data analysis. I really enjoyed it and over the last few years, I tried to hone those skills at work and through my personal projects. I created this website in an effort to share my personal data science projects. My blog contains everything related to data that I found interesting to write about, and the section  "Data Science Projects" lists my comprehensive projects.
