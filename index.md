Hi, I'm Shama. I created this website to share my personal datascience projects. I am currently an engineer at Intel, and I did my PhD in Mechanical Engineering from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in 2018. Near the end of my grad school, I got myself involved into coding and rigorous data analysis. Over the last few years, I tried to hone those skills at work and through my personal projects.
