Testing, Hi, I'm Shama. I created this website to share my personal datascience projects. I am currently an engineer at Intel, and I did my PhD in Mechanical Engineering from University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in 2018. Near the end of my grad school, I got myself involved into coding and rigorous data analysis. Over the last few years, I tried to hone those skills at work and through my personal projects. 

Aside from work, I also finished a 6 month long immersive bootcamp with Springboard Academy where the curriculum covered concepts on Python for Data Science, Inferential Statistics (hypothesis testing, experimental design, A/B testing), Relational Databases (SQL), supervised & unsupervised machine learning and Neural Networks, as well as advanced topics on Time Series Forecasting, Recommender Systems, NLP and Spark.
