## Projects
### 1. Predict Cast Member of the show "Friends" - [Article, ](https://github.com/shamafarabi/Predicting-Cast-Member-of-the-TV-show-Friends-using-NLP/blob/master/Project%20Report.ipynb)[Repository](https://github.com/shamafarabi/Predicting-Cast-Member-of-the-TV-show-Friends-using-NLP)

I was curious to know if  NLP can be used to identify movie/TV show characters from any line they have said in the show by using the transcripts of the show as the source of dataset. So I decided to build this project using the popular TV show 'Friends' as the test case. I webscraped text transcripts of 235 episodes of Friends and processed the data in a dataframe with 489,44 observations such that the lines said by different cast members can be used as input to train different ML models. I implemented interactive visualization to identify insights about the members and  explored different word embedding methods (count-vectorizer,tf-idf, word2vec etc.), resampling techniques, ML (multinomial naive bayes, logistic regression, support vector machines) and DL models for identifying the characters.

### 2. Predict Users Ratings and Recommend New Books to Read - [Article,](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/shamafarabi/Capstone_1_Book_Recommendation/blob/master/Milestone%20Report/Milestone%20Report.ipynb)[Repository](Book_Recommendation_Engine)
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
Book reading apps like Goodreads has personally helped me to find books I couldnâ€™t put away and thus getting back to the habit of reading regularly again. In this project, I developed a collaborative filterning based book recommendation model using goodreads dataset that can suggest readers what books to read next.  Utilizing exploratory data analysis on  6,000,000 user ratings, 10,000 books and 34,252 book tags, I identified business insights  about goodreads users reading preferences (e.g. how they like to tag books, what ratings they usually provide etc.) and current trends in the book market (book categories that are in demand, successful authors in the market etc.). Then I utilized ML models (KNN, SVD and NMF) to predict user ratings to books they are yet to read and implemented personalized and non-personalized recommendation system.

 ### 3. A Web App for Image Classification using fastai -[Repository](https://github.com/shamafarabi/fastai-v3)
In this project, I made an image classification web app using fastai to identify different types of car. Image data was collected for different cars and labeled using Google Image Search for different body types(SUV,Sedan, Convertible and Trucks, Racing cars). A renet34 pretrained model was used for transfer learning with fastai and then deployed online. you can try it out [here](https://car-make-detection.onrender.com/)
